- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    - `function components are not able to use the react life cycle methods`

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    - `Constructor: Initializes component in memory.` 
      `componentDidMount: Function that runs after a component mounts successfully, NOT when it his created in memory. `
      `componentWillUnmount: Last dying breath of a component, typically suited for cleaning up.`

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    - `To add extra functionality on top of simply reading and writing to state. This is just javascript and can be used in countless powerful ways`

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    - `To ensure our users aren't doing the testing FOR us. Testing will always happen, it is best to do the testing in development rather than in deployment.`
